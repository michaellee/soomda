## ðŸ™ˆ Soomda

An Obsidian plugin that lets you quickly hide your sidebars.

## Getting started
- Once Soomda is installed, make sure the plugin is activated under *Community plugins > Installed plugins* in *Settings*
- Once activated, you'll see a new leaf-shaped icon in the left hand ribbon. This is the toggle to turn Soomda on and off.

## To develop

- Clone repository
- Run `npm i` to install dependencies
- Run `npm run dev`

## To install from repo

- Follow steps above in "To develop" section
- Instead of running `npm run dev`, you want to run `npm run build`
- Create a folder in your vault's `.obsidian/plugins` folder called "soomda"
- Then copy and paste the `main.js` and `manifest.json` files into the new soomda folder
- Activate community plugins by turning off safe mode under settings and you should now see the option to turn on Soomda
